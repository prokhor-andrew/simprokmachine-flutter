# simprokmachine


## Introduction
 
Every application consists of the classes that refer to the other classes, which refer to the other classes etc. It is a tree of classes where each one knows about its children and doesn't know about its parent.

In general, classes communicate with each other by calling methods and properties of their children to pass data "down" or by triggering a callback passing data "up" to the parent.

Moreover, we have many patterns to make this communication easier such as delegate, facade, observable, command, etc. And we haven't even started discussing how to pass data from the logic's layer to the UI.

## Problem

Every time the communication must be organized it is up to us to decide which pattern to use, and how to handle it. This requires attention and can easily result in unexpected bugs.

## Solution

```simprokmachine``` is a framework that automates the communication between the application's components called "machines".

## How to use

Machine - is an instance in your application that receives and processes input data and may emit output.

![concept](https://github.com/simprok-dev/simprokmachine-flutter/blob/main/images/simprokmachine.drawio.png)

To create it use ```ChildMachine``` class.

```Dart
class PrinterMachine extends ChildMachine<String, bool> {
    
    @override
    void process(String? input, Handler<bool> callback) {
        log(input);
    }
}
```

If your machine must update flutter widgets with its input - use ```ChildWidgetMachine``` instead. Combine it with ```MachineConsumer``` to update UI where needed.

```Dart
class PrinterWidgetMachine extends ChildWidgetMachine<String, bool> {

    @override
    Widget child() {
      return MaterialApp( 
          home: Scaffold(
            body: Center(
              child: MachineConsumer<String, bool>(
                initial: (BuildContext context) => Text("UI before first input was received"),
                builder: (BuildContext context, String? input, Handler<bool> callback) => Text("UI when input received: $input")
              ),
            ),
          ),
      ),
    }
}
```


To start the flow use ```runRootMachine()``` method in your ```main()``` function.

```Dart
void main() {

    runRootMachine<String, bool>(
        root: PrinterWidgetMachine(),
    );
}
```

This does not print anything but ```null``` because after ```startRootMachine()``` is called the root is subscribed to the child machine triggering ```process()``` method with ```null``` value.

Use ```Handler<Output> callback``` to emit output. 

```Dart
class EmittingMachine extends ChildMachine<String, bool> {
    
    void process(String? input, Handler<bool> callback) {
        if (input != null) { 
            log("input: \(input)");
        } else {
            callback(false); // Emits output
        }
    }
}
```

Standard implementations of ```ChildMachine``` are ```BasicMachine``` and ```ProcessMachine```.

```Dart
final machine = BasicMachine<int, bool>((int? input, Handler<bool> callback) {
    // handle input here
    // emit outuput if needed
});
```

and

```Dart
final machine = ProcessMachine<int, bool>(this, (thisObject, int? input, bool callback) { 
    // handle input here
    // emit outuput if needed
});
```

And there is also an implementation of ```BasicWidgetMachine``` if you want to inject your widget without extraÂ classes.

```Dart
final machine = BasicWidgetMachine<int, bool>(child: MyAppWidget());
```

To unite two or more machines where one machine is ```WidgetMachine``` and another one is plain ```Machine``` use ```mergeWidgetMachine()```.

```Dart
void main() {

    runRootMachine<String, bool>(
        root: mergeWidgetMachine(
          main: PrinterWidgetMachine(),
          secondary: { PrinterMachine(), },
        ), 
    );
}
```

To merge more than one machine together - use ```merge()```.

```Dart
final Machine<Input, Output> machine1 = ...
final Machine<Input, Output> machine2 = ...

... = merge({
    machine1,
    machine2,
});
```

To separate machines into classes instead of cluttering them up in the ```runRootMachine()```, use ```ParentMachine``` or ```ParentWidgetMachine``` classes.

```Dart
class IntermediateLayer extends ParentMachine<String, bool> {

    @override
    Machine<String, bool> child() {
        return PrinterMachine(); // or PrinterWidgetMachine() if extends ParentWidgetMachine
    }
}
```


To map or ignore input - use ```inward()```.

```Dart
... = machine.inward((ParentInput parentInput) {
    return Ward.values([ChildInput(), ChildInput(), ChildInput()]); // pass zero, one or more outputs.
})
```


To map or ignore output - use ```outward()```. 

```Dart
... = machine.outward((ChildOutput childOutput) {
    return Ward.values([ParentOutput(), ParentOutput(), ParentOutput()]); // pass zero, one or more outputs.
});
```

To send input back to the child when output received - use ```redirect()```.

```Dart
... = machine.redirect((ChildOutput childOutput) { 
    // Return 
    // Direction.prop() - for pushing ChildOutput further to the root.
    // Direction.back(Ward.values([ChildInput()])) - for sending child inputs back to the child.
    ...
});
```


To dynamically create and connect machines when new input received - use ```ConnectableMachine```.

```Dart
... = ConnectableMachine<int, bool, BasicConnection<int, bool>>.create(
    BasicConnection({
        MyMachine1(), 
        MyMachine2(),
    }), 
    (BasicConnection<int, bool> state, int input) { 
        // Return 
        // ConnectionType<int, bool, BasicConnection<int, bool>>.reduce(BasicConnection<int, bool>({})) - when new machines have to be connected.
        // ConnectionType<int, bool, BasicConnection<int, bool>>.inward() - when existing machines have to receive input: Int
    }
); 
```

## Killer-features

- Declarative way of describing your application's behavior.
- Automated concurrency management saves from race conditions, deadlocks, and headache.
- Flexible. Every existing component can become a machine.
- Modular. Every machine can be described once and reused easily.
- Cross-platform. [Kotlin](https://github.com/simprok-dev/simprokmachine-kotlin) and [Native iOS](https://github.com/simprok-dev/simprokmachine-ios) supported.


## Installation

Add the line into pubspec.yaml:

```
dependencies:
    simprokmachine: ^1.1.1
